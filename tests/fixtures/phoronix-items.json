        "content": "Multi-Lane SPI Support Merged For Linux 7.0 Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 13 February 2026 at 01:32 PM EST. 1 Comment With the Serial Peripheral Interface \"SPI\" subsystem updates for the Linux 7.0 kernel comes support for multi-lane SPI. Multi-lane SPI support is for SPI controllers and peripherals having multiple data lanes with those data lanes being independent sets of SDI/SDO lines and each with their own serialize/deserializer attached. The documentation patch for this multi-lane work led by BayLibre's David Lechner explains the ins and outs of multi-lane SPI. \"The highlight here is that David Lechner has added support for multi-lane SPI devices. Unlike the existing dual/quad SPI support this is for devices (typically ADCs/DACs) which support multiple independent data streams over multiple data lanes, instead of sending one data stream N times as fast they simultaneously transfer N different data streams. This is very similar to the case where multiple devices are grouped together but in this case it's a single device in a way that's visible to software. Otherwise there's been quite a bit of work on existing drivers, both cleanup and feature improvement, and a reasonable collection of new drivers.\" More details on these SPI changes for Linux 7.0 via this pull that has already been merged to Git. 1 Comment"

Add A Comment Adding to the exciting features for the big Linux 7.0 kernel release is support for the Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm \"ML-DSA\" quantum-resistant signature algorithm. The ML-DSA/Dilithium signature algorithm support is initially going to be used for module signing while eventually other ML-DSA uses are expected throughout the kernel. This ML-DSA introduction for signing within the kernel comes in the same release of Linux finally removing SHA-1 module signing support . The crypto library pull request that landed the support for verifying ML-DSA signatures explained: \"ML-DSA (Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm) is a recently-standardized post-quantum (quantum-resistant) signature algorithm. It was known as Dilithium pre-standardization. The first use case in the kernel will be module signing. But there are also other users of RSA and ECDSA signatures in the kernel that might want to upgrade to ML-DSA eventually.\" While this cryptography standard is designed for quantum resilience, it's engineered for fast signing and verification today. ML-DSA can serve as a replacement to RSA and ECC for authentication and data integrity purposes. In addition to that initial ML-DSA support is also AES library updates in the now-merged crypto library pull. Add A Comment"

        "content": "Evaluating The Performance Cost To AMD SEV-SNP On EPYC 9005 VMs Written by Michael Larabel in Cloud on 13 February 2026 at 10:17 AM EST. Page 1 of 8 . Add A Comment . AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization with Secure Nested Paging ( SEV-SNP ) provides memory encryption and integrity protections that can be especially useful in modern cloud computing. Typically a 2~10% performance overhead is reported when engaging AMD SEV-SNP for these hardware-backed security protections. In this article is an extensive look at the current AMD SEV-SNP performance impact for confidential computing on EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" servers. The current Ubuntu 24.04 LTS was tested as well as an Ubuntu 26.04 development snapshot in evaluating the latest optimizations and what is on the horizon this year for AMD EPYC Linux server performance. AMD SEV-SNP provides memory integrity protections to help fend off malicious hypervisor-based attacks, other improvements over SEV-ES on earlier EPYC CPUs for greater VM security, interrupt protections, and better protections against side channel attacks. The latest EPYC 9005 processors also support SEV Trusted I/O for protections against PCIe devices but that is outside of the scope of today's testing. Typically 2% to 8~10% is cited as the performance overhead to engaging SEV-SNP while some workloads may see upwards of 10~12% such as for database servers and other I/O heavy workloads. Running a well-rounded set of benchmarks for evaluating the AMD SEV-SNP overhead has long been on my TODO list and leveraging the Azure public cloud makes it easy to conduct such a real-world comparison in a production environment. For measuring the performance impact of modern AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization in a real-world environment, AMD provided gratis access to two Microsoft Azure public cloud instances: one with SEV-SNP for confidential computing and the second instance the same configuration but without SEV-SNP protections. Thus a clean 1:1 look at the AMD SEV-SNP impact in the public cloud and with all the latest patches at the time applied by Microsoft's cloud engineers. The Azure v7 series VMs were powered by AMD EPYC 9V74 80-core processors but for this testing was done in a 16 vCPU configuration comprised of eight physical cores and sixteen threads -- given that the 16 vCPU size being quite common among VMs. With the 16 vCPUs was 64GB of memory and 550GB of virtual storage. The confidential VM (CVM) with SEV-SNP and the default non-confidential VM were running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with the Linux 6.14 kernel and GCC 13.2 compiler by default. Following that on each VM I then upgraded to an Ubuntu 26.04 development snapshot to look at the performance impact of the newer kernel, GCC 15 compiler, and other upgrades ahead of the official Ubuntu 26.04 LTS release in April. Thanks to AMD for providing the free access to these VMs for being able to run a default vs. SEV-SNP confidential VM comparison on Azure's cloud.
